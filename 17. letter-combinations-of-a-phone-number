To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible letter combinations that can be formed from the digits on a phone keypad. Each digit from 2-9 maps to a set of letters, similar to how phone keypads work. Here’s how we can approach the solution.

### Approach

1. **Mapping Digits to Letters**: We know that each digit (from 2 to 9) maps to a set of letters:
   - `2` → `"abc"`
   - `3` → `"def"`
   - `4` → `"ghi"`
   - `5` → `"jkl"`
   - `6` → `"mno"`
   - `7` → `"pqrs"`
   - `8` → `"tuv"`
   - `9` → `"wxyz"`
   
2. **Base Case**: If the input string `digits` is empty, we return an empty list `[]`, as there are no combinations to form.

3. **Recursive or Iterative Combination Generation**:
   - For each digit, we get the corresponding letters and combine each letter with the combinations generated from the remaining digits.
   - This can be solved effectively using recursion (backtracking) or an iterative approach.

4. **Backtracking Solution**:
   - Start from an empty combination.
   - For each digit, add each possible letter to the current combination and move to the next digit.
   - Once we reach the end of the digits, add the current combination to the results.

### Code Implementation

Here’s a Python solution using backtracking:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        # Mapping from digits to corresponding letters
        phone_map = {
            "2": "abc", "3": "def", "4": "ghi", "5": "jkl",
            "6": "mno", "7": "pqrs", "8": "tuv", "9": "wxyz"
        }
        
        # Result list to store all combinations
        results = []
        
        # Base case: if digits is empty, return an empty list
        if not digits:
            return results
        
        # Helper function to perform backtracking
        def backtrack(index: int, current_combination: str):
            # If the current combination is complete, add it to results
            if index == len(digits):
                results.append(current_combination)
                return
            
            # Get the letters corresponding to the current digit
            possible_letters = phone_map[digits[index]]
            
            # Loop through each letter and append it to the current combination
            for letter in possible_letters:
                backtrack(index + 1, current_combination + letter)
        
        # Start the backtracking from the first digit
        backtrack(0, "")
        
        return results
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Mapping Phone Digits**: We define `phone_map` to store the mapping from digits to their corresponding letters.
2. **Base Case**: If `digits` is an empty string, we return `results`, which is an empty list.
3. **Backtracking Function** (`backtrack`):
   - The `index` parameter keeps track of the current position in the `digits` string.
   - `current_combination` holds the current combination of letters we are building.
   - If `index` reaches the length of `digits`, it means we’ve formed a complete combination, so we add `current_combination` to `results`.
   - For each letter corresponding to the current digit, we call `backtrack` recursively with the next index and the updated `current_combination`.
4. **Return Results**: Finally, `results` contains all possible letter combinations, which we return.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1: `digits = "23"`
1. **Mapping**:
   - `2` maps to `["a", "b", "c"]`
   - `3` maps to `["d", "e", "f"]`
2. **Backtracking**:
   - Start with `index = 0` and `current_combination = ""`.
   - For `2`, add each letter (`"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`) to `current_combination` and move to the next digit.
   - For each letter from `2`, add each letter from `3` (`"d"`, `"e"`, `"f"`) to form combinations like `"ad"`, `"ae"`, `"af"`, etc.
3. **Result**: `["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]`.

#### Example 2: `digits = ""`
- Since `digits` is empty, return `[]`.

#### Example 3: `digits = "2"`
- Only one digit, so return the letters for `2`: `["a", "b", "c"]`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(3^n \times 4^m)\), where \(n\) is the number of digits that map to 3 letters (`2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `8`) and \(m\) is the number of digits that map to 4 letters (`7`, `9`). In the worst case, we explore all possible combinations.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(3^n \times 4^m)\) for storing the results.

This solution is efficient and leverages backtracking to explore each combination in a structured way.
