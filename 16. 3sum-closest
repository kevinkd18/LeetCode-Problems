To solve this problem, we need to find three numbers in the array `nums` such that their sum is as close as possible to the given `target`. The approach is similar to the "3-sum" problem but with a slight modification to minimize the difference between the sum and the target instead of finding an exact match.

### Approach

1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the array `nums` to use the two-pointer technique effectively.
2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - We need a variable `closest_sum` to keep track of the closest sum found so far. Initially, we can set it to a large value or assign it the sum of the first three elements in `nums`.
3. **Iterate with a Fixed Point**: Use a loop to iterate through each element in the sorted array `nums`, treating it as the first number in the triplet.
4. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - For each number at index `i`, set up two pointers: `left` just after `i` and `right` at the end of the array.
   - Calculate the sum of `nums[i]`, `nums[left]`, and `nums[right]`.
   - If this sum is closer to the `target` than the current `closest_sum`, update `closest_sum`.
   - If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to the right (to increase the sum).
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to the left (to decrease the sum).
5. **Return the Closest Sum**: Once all possible triplets have been evaluated, `closest_sum` will hold the closest possible sum to the target.

### Code Implementation

Hereâ€™s how this approach translates into Python code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Sort the array
        nums.sort()
        
        # Initialize the closest sum to the sum of the first three elements
        closest_sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]
        
        # Step 2: Iterate through each number in the sorted array
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
            left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
            
            # Step 3: Two-pointer technique
            while left < right:
                current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
                
                # Update closest sum if the current sum is closer to the target
                if abs(current_sum - target) < abs(closest_sum - target):
                    closest_sum = current_sum
                
                # Move pointers based on the comparison with the target
                if current_sum < target:
                    left += 1  # We need a larger sum
                elif current_sum > target:
                    right -= 1  # We need a smaller sum
                else:
                    # If the current sum is exactly equal to the target, we found the closest possible sum
                    return current_sum
        
        return closest_sum
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Sorting**: `nums.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order.
2. **Initialize Closest Sum**: The initial `closest_sum` is set to the sum of the first three elements. This acts as our starting point for comparison.
3. **Outer Loop**: The `for` loop iterates through each element in `nums` (up to the third-last element since we need triplets).
4. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - `left` starts just after `i`, and `right` starts at the end of the array.
   - **Update Closest Sum**: For each triplet sum, if the absolute difference between `current_sum` and `target` is less than the absolute difference between `closest_sum` and `target`, we update `closest_sum`.
   - **Move Pointers**:
     - If `current_sum < target`, increment `left` to try to get a larger sum.
     - If `current_sum > target`, decrement `right` to try to get a smaller sum.
     - If `current_sum == target`, return `current_sum` immediately because we found an exact match.
5. **Return Closest Sum**: After the loop, `closest_sum` holds the closest sum to the target.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums`. Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\), and the two-pointer scan for each element takes \(O(n)\), making the overall complexity \(O(n^2)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we are only using a few extra variables for calculations and do not need additional data structures that grow with the input size.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1: `nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4]`, `target = 1`

1. **Sorted Array**: `nums = [-4, -1, 1, 2]`
2. **Iterations**:
   - `i = 0`, `nums[i] = -4`
     - `left = 1`, `right = 3`: `current_sum = -4 + (-1) + 2 = -3`
       - `closest_sum` is updated to `-3` because `abs(-3 - 1) < abs(initial closest_sum - 1)`.
     - Move `left` to 2: `current_sum = -4 + 1 + 2 = -1`
       - `closest_sum` is updated to `-1` because `abs(-1 - 1) < abs(-3 - 1)`.
     - Move `left` to 3, end inner loop.
   - `i = 1`, `nums[i] = -1`
     - `left = 2`, `right = 3`: `current_sum = -1 + 1 + 2 = 2`
       - `closest_sum` is updated to `2` because `abs(2 - 1) < abs(-1 - 1)`.
3. **Result**: Closest sum is `2`.

#### Example 2: `nums = [0, 0, 0]`, `target = 1`

- **Sorted Array**: `nums = [0, 0, 0]`
- `closest_sum = 0`, which is the only possible sum, so the result is `0`.

This approach efficiently finds the triplet sum that is closest to the target.
