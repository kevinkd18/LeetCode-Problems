This problem can be solved using a two-pointer approach, which is efficient and avoids the need for a brute-force O(n^2) solution. Here’s how it works:

### Explanation

The two-pointer technique involves placing two pointers, one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the `height` array. The area between the lines at these two pointers can be calculated by the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height}
\]

where:
- `width` is the distance between the two pointers (`right - left`),
- `height` is the minimum of the two heights at the pointers (`min(height[left], height[right])`).

To maximize the area, the algorithm follows these steps:
1. Start with `left` at the beginning of the array and `right` at the end.
2. Calculate the current area based on `left` and `right`.
3. Update the maximum area if the current area is greater than the previous maximum.
4. Move the pointer corresponding to the shorter line inward, as moving the taller line inward won’t increase the area (since height is limited by the shorter line).
5. Repeat until the two pointers meet.

### Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0
        
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the current area
            width = right - left
            current_height = min(height[left], height[right])
            current_area = width * current_height
            
            # Update max_area if the current_area is greater
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)
            
            # Move the pointer corresponding to the shorter line
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        
        return max_area
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `height` array. This is because each element is processed only once as the pointers move inward.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since only a few extra variables are used for pointers and storing the maximum area.

### Example Walkthrough

For `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`:

1. **Initial**: `left = 0`, `right = 8`, `max_area = 0`
   - Area = \( \min(1, 7) \times (8 - 0) = 1 \times 8 = 8 \)
   - Update `max_area` to 8.
   - Move `left` pointer because `height[left] < height[right]`.

2. **Next**: `left = 1`, `right = 8`
   - Area = \( \min(8, 7) \times (8 - 1) = 7 \times 7 = 49 \)
   - Update `max_area` to 49.
   - Move `right` pointer because `height[right] < height[left]`.

Continue in this manner until the pointers meet. By the end, the maximum area found is 49.

### Summary

This two-pointer solution is efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n)\), and makes it possible to find the maximum area without examining every possible pair of lines.
