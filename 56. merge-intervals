Here's a detailed, line-by-line explanation of the `merge` function that merges overlapping intervals:

```python
class Solution:
  def merge(self, intervals: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
```

This defines the `merge` function inside a `Solution` class. It takes `intervals` as input, which is a list of lists, where each sublist represents an interval with a start and an end time. The function returns a list of merged, non-overlapping intervals.

```python
    ans = []
```

`ans` is initialized as an empty list. This will store the final merged intervals.

```python
    for interval in sorted(intervals):
```

Here, we sort `intervals` based on the start times of each interval. Sorting is essential to simplify the merging logic because it allows us to handle intervals in sequential order. We iterate through each `interval` in the sorted list.

```python
      if not ans or ans[-1][1] < interval[0]:
```

This line checks if:
- `ans` is empty (`not ans`), which is true for the very first interval.
- The current interval does not overlap with the last interval in `ans`. We determine this by checking if the end of the last interval in `ans` (`ans[-1][1]`) is less than the start of the current interval (`interval[0]`).

If either condition is true, it means there’s no overlap, and we can directly add the current interval to `ans`.

```python
        ans.append(interval)
```

If there’s no overlap, we add `interval` to `ans`.

```python
      else:
        ans[-1][1] = max(ans[-1][1], interval[1])
```

If the current interval overlaps with the last interval in `ans`, we merge them by updating the end of the last interval in `ans`. We set `ans[-1][1]` to the maximum of the end of the last interval in `ans` (`ans[-1][1]`) and the end of the current interval (`interval[1]`). This effectively extends the last interval to cover both intervals.

```python
    return ans
```

Finally, we return `ans`, which now contains the merged, non-overlapping intervals.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`.

1. **Sort**: `[[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]`
2. **Process Intervals**:
   - `ans` is initially empty, so `[1,3]` is added.
   - `[2,6]` overlaps with `[1,3]` (since `3 >= 2`), so they are merged to `[1,6]`.
   - `[8,10]` doesn’t overlap with `[1,6]`, so `[8,10]` is added to `ans`.
   - `[15,18]` doesn’t overlap with `[8,10]`, so `[15,18]` is added.

The output is `[[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) due to sorting. The merging process itself takes \(O(n)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), as we store the merged intervals in `ans`.
