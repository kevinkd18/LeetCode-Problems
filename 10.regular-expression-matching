This solution uses a recursive approach to implement regular expression matching with `.` and `*`, covering the entire string. Here’s a breakdown of how the code works.

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Base Case (Empty Pattern)**:
   - If the `pattern` is empty (`not pattern`), return `True` only if `text` is also empty, meaning both strings have been fully matched. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **First Match Check**:
   - `first_match` checks if the first character of `text` matches the first character of `pattern`, or if the first character of `pattern` is `.` (which can match any character).
   - This is done by verifying:
     ```python
     first_match = bool(text) and pattern[0] in {text[0], "."}
     ```
   - `bool(text)` ensures that `text` is non-empty (so we avoid an index error).

3. **Handling the `*` Character**:
   - If `pattern` has at least two characters, and the second character is `*`, then we consider two cases:
     - **Zero occurrences of the character before `*`**: Move to the next part of the pattern by calling `self.isMatch(text, pattern[2:])`.
     - **One or more occurrences of the character before `*`**: Only if `first_match` is `True`, we move one character forward in `text` and keep the `*` in `pattern`, calling `self.isMatch(text[1:], pattern)`.

4. **If `*` is Not the Second Character**:
   - If there’s no `*`, simply move one character forward in both `text` and `pattern` by calling `self.isMatch(text[1:], pattern[1:])`, but only if `first_match` is `True`.

5. **Return Results**:
   - The function will return `True` or `False` depending on whether `text` and `pattern` match.

### Code Example:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isMatch(self, text: str, pattern: str) -> bool:
        # Base case: if pattern is empty, return True only if text is also empty
        if not pattern:
            return not text

        # Check if the first character matches or pattern[0] is '.'
        first_match = bool(text) and pattern[0] in {text[0], "."}

        # Handle '*' in the pattern
        if len(pattern) >= 2 and pattern[1] == "*":
            # Try zero occurrence of the preceding character or one/more occurrences if first_match
            return (
                self.isMatch(text, pattern[2:]) or
                (first_match and self.isMatch(text[1:], pattern))
            )
        else:
            # Move one character forward in both text and pattern if first_match
            return first_match and self.isMatch(text[1:], pattern[1:])
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: Exponential in the worst case, \(O(2^{n+m})\), where \(n\) is the length of `text` and \(m\) is the length of `pattern`. This is because each `*` can lead to multiple recursive calls.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n + m)\), as each recursive call adds to the call stack.

This recursive approach is elegant and easy to understand but can be slow for longer strings and patterns due to repeated calculations. Using a dynamic programming (DP) approach, as shown in the previous solution, can optimize performance by avoiding redundant recursive calls.
