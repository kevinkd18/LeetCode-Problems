Here’s a line-by-line explanation of the `consecutiveNumbersSum` function, which calculates how many ways an integer `n` can be written as the sum of consecutive positive integers.

### Problem Summary
Given an integer `n`, find the number of ways it can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. For example:
- `n = 15` can be represented as `15 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5` or `15 = 4 + 5 + 6`, etc.
- The task is to count all such ways.

### Solution Approach

This solution is based on a mathematical property:  
For any integer `n`, if `n` can be represented as the sum of `k` consecutive numbers, starting from `x`, then:
  
\[
n = x + (x+1) + (x+2) + \dots + (x + k - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
n = kx + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}
\]

Rearranging, we get:

\[
kx = n - \frac{k(k-1)}{2}
\]

This approach iterates over possible values of `k`, the length of each possible sequence, to see if a valid `x` exists for each `k`.

### Code Explanation

```python
class Solution:
  def consecutiveNumbersSum(self, n: int) -> int:
```

This defines the `consecutiveNumbersSum` function inside a `Solution` class. The function takes `n` as an integer input and returns the number of ways `n` can be expressed as a sum of consecutive numbers.

```python
    ans = 0
```

- `ans` is initialized to zero. This variable will keep track of the total number of valid ways to represent `n`.

```python
    i = 1
    triangleNum = 1
```

- `i` represents the length of each sequence we’re testing, starting from `1`.
- `triangleNum` keeps track of the triangular number for the current sequence length `i`. The triangular number is given by \(\frac{i(i-1)}{2}\), which helps in calculating the expression \(n - \frac{i(i-1)}{2}\).

```python
    while triangleNum <= n:
```

- This loop runs while `triangleNum` (the triangular number) is less than or equal to `n`. Once `triangleNum` exceeds `n`, it’s impossible to find any further sequences.

```python
      if (n - triangleNum) % i == 0:
        ans += 1
```

- For each `i`, we check if `n - triangleNum` is divisible by `i`. If true, it implies that there exists an integer `x` such that `n` can be represented as the sum of `i` consecutive numbers starting from `x`.
- If this condition is met, `ans` is incremented by `1` since we’ve found a valid sequence.

```python
      i += 1
      triangleNum += i
```

- `i` is incremented to test the next sequence length.
- `triangleNum` is updated to the next triangular number, which will be used in the next iteration.

```python
    return ans
```

- Finally, `ans` is returned, which contains the total count of valid sequences.

### Example Walkthrough

For example, if `n = 15`:
1. `i = 1`: \( \text{triangleNum} = 1 \), so \(15 - 1 = 14\), which is divisible by `1`. So, `ans += 1`.
2. `i = 2`: \( \text{triangleNum} = 3 \), so \(15 - 3 = 12\), which is divisible by `2`. So, `ans += 1`.
3. `i = 3`: \( \text{triangleNum} = 6 \), so \(15 - 6 = 9\), which is divisible by `3`. So, `ans += 1`.
4. `i = 4`: \( \text{triangleNum} = 10 \), so \(15 - 10 = 5\), which is divisible by `4`. So, `ans += 1`.

This gives a final count of `4`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\sqrt{n})\), since the loop runs while `triangleNum` is less than or equal to `n`, and `triangleNum` grows quadratically with `i`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we only use a few extra variables.
