Thanks for pointing that out! I see where the issue lies. When checking each element in the `nums` list, we need to ensure that after subtracting a prime, the resulting element is still greater than the previous element in the list to keep it strictly increasing.

I’ll adjust the code so that, for each element, we attempt to subtract the largest possible prime that keeps it larger than the previous element. Here’s the updated code:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def sieve_of_eratosthenes(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        """ Helper function to generate primes up to n using Sieve of Eratosthenes. """
        is_prime = [True] * (n + 1)
        p = 2
        while (p * p <= n):
            if (is_prime[p] == True):
                for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                    is_prime[i] = False
            p += 1
        return [p for p in range(2, n + 1) if is_prime[p]]

    def primeSubOperation(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Generate all primes up to 1000
        primes = self.sieve_of_eratosthenes(1000)
        
        # Traverse the array from left to right
        prev = 0  # Initialize prev to be less than the first element
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # Check if nums[i] is already greater than prev
            if nums[i] > prev:
                # Find the largest prime less than nums[i] that results in nums[i] > prev
                for p in reversed(primes):
                    if p < nums[i] and nums[i] - p > prev:
                        nums[i] -= p
                        break
            # If no prime is subtracted and nums[i] <= prev, then it's not possible
            if nums[i] <= prev:
                return False
            # Update prev to the current value
            prev = nums[i]
        
        return True
```

### Explanation of the Fix
1. We iterate through each element in `nums`.
2. For each element `nums[i]`, we check if it's already strictly greater than the previous element (`prev`). If it is, we can move on to the next element.
3. If `nums[i]` is not already greater than `prev`, we look for the largest prime that:
   - is less than `nums[i]`
   - allows the new value of `nums[i] - p` to be greater than `prev`
4. If such a prime is found, we subtract it from `nums[i]`.
5. If no valid prime subtraction is possible to make `nums[i]` greater than `prev`, we return `False`.
6. If we successfully iterate through the list with each element becoming strictly greater than the previous one, we return `True`.
